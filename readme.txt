Adds pseudo oembed support for RSS feeds

== Description ==

Will add a list of links to items in a given feed.
Simply include the URL for an RSS feed on it's own line, or wrapped in the embed tag like `[embed]http://example.com/feed.rss[/embed]` and the plugin will embed the feed the page with links to each item.
The url must end with `.rss`

== Installation ==

1. Upload `dirtysuds-embed-rss` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate **DirtySuds - Embed RSS** through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it. Now when you embed an RSS feed using the Wordpress `[embed]` shortcode, the plugin will embed the feed
